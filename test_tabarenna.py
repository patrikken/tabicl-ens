"""Generate TabArena's main (living) leaderboard.

Builds the leaderboard from the *latest* results for every benchmarked method
(the default ``TabArenaContext()`` method collection, which grows as new methods
and results land). Use this to see where methods stand on the current TabArena
suite.

For the *frozen* NeurIPS 2025 leaderboard from the paper, see
``examples/reproducibility/run_generate_main_leaderboard_neurips2025.py``.

Results download to ``~/.cache/tabarena/`` on first run. ``compare()`` returns the
leaderboard DataFrame and writes the leaderboard CSVs and figures under ``output_dir``.
One of those CSVs is ``results_per_split.csv``, the numbers the leaderboard aggregates:
one row per dataset, split and method with the test and validation error, the train and
inference time, and an ``imputed`` flag. The per-split results are not hosted anywhere;
this script writes them, and ``run_export_results_per_split.py`` next to it writes only
the CSVs and skips the figures. ``leaderboard_to_website_format()`` reshapes the
leaderboard into the columns shown on the website.
